		<ContentPlain>MAJOR EVENT PROTOCOL
The officer shall send the review form within 5 days from the reception of the review request.
The procedure shall be carried out before the end of March 2015.
Scope

The City of Austin has established a major event initiative that is supported by the Police Department, EMS and Fire Department. This initiative creates a team of city personnel to handle any incident of natural or manmade disasters that occur in the City of Austin. This team is responsible for search and rescue, investigation and assisting other agencies responsible for major events. Command Staff will determine whether an incident demands major event status.

Responsibilities

1. Major Event Team
A. Made up of Police Department personnel who are placed in areas of responsibility within
their expertise.
B. Each employee is assigned to a specific team and answers to command staff in that
team.
C. Personnel will be divided into these two groups, Alpha and Bravo, to handle the major
event scene, while continuing essential functions in the area of crime scene and evidence control.
2. The group will include personnel assigned to the major event and personnel assigned to other essential functions.
3. Positions, not individuals, are assigned to specific duties.
A. Individual assignments will be made at the time the major event schedule is initiated. B. The assignments must remain flexible, dependent on the type and extent of the major
event.
4. The two teams will work 12-hour shifts/7 days per week, until the major event status is terminated.
5. Shifts will be 7am/7pm and 7pm/7am.
6. An example of position assignments is found in Appendix 27A.

Practices

1. Major Event Call Out

A. Upon occurrence of a major event the Manager and Assistant Manager will be initially
contacted.
B. Management will respond to the designated location for briefing.
C. Once briefed, evidence the Management team is responsible for initiating a call out to supervisors within the Forensic Science Division with the following information:
• Shift designation for each supervisor;
• Briefing on event;
• Location of command post;
• Immediate manpower needs;
• Immediate and future equipment/supply resources; • Any special instructions.
D. The supervisors will be responsible for assigning their employees to a position on the major event schedule, ensuring that all personnel are assigned a position.
E. When contacting personnel to ensure that they are aware of the event and to furnish instructions, the following information should be shared:
• Shift assignment;
• Event briefing;
• Location of command post;
• Any special instructions;
F. One Crime Scene Unit supervisor will be assigned to make notifications and assignments
for the Crime Scene Section.
G. The page for a major event will be sent as follows:
• “Major Event in Progress – Contact (Supervisor Name) and (telephone #)”.
H. All personnel will at all times have their pager available as outlined in the APD General
Orders and will respond immediately to a major event call out.
• Extended periods of absence as pre-approved by the supervisor are excused from this
response.
• Failure to respond to page will be subject to disciplinary action.
I. Personnel not assigned pagers will be contacted telephonically by the supervisor.
J. The supervisor needs to be aware of any extended periods of time that an employee will
be unavailable.

2. Response

A. On Duty Field Units will not respond immediately to a major event. Their response will be at the discretion of Management.
• Employees will not be put into an unsafe situation, which is highly probable at the
onset of a major event.
B. Off duty personnel will respond as determined by Management.
• Supervisors will advise the personnel what schedule they are to work and their assignment.
• Personnel will then work the assignment until reassigned or until the major event status is terminated.
• Personnel deemed as support staff will be assigned to a specific team and be assigned support functions as determined by Management.

3. Scene Safety

A. In a major event hazards will exist.
B. EMS and Fire are responsible for the securing of the location and ensuring that hazards
are minimized before Police Department staff is utilized.
C. Fire will also be monitoring the scene during the investigation period to ensure that
hazards to personnel are readily identified and remedied.
D. Division Safety Officer and Chemistry Section supervisor will act as Forensic Division
Safety personnel.
• Any exposure or injury will be reported immediately to the supervisor who will direct the injured to EMS for screening/treatment.
• Any report of exposure or injury will be documented on department forms by the safety officers and forwarded to the employee’s regular chain of command and to Workers Compensation office.
• Forensic Chemistry Section personnel will also be assisting the Lab Team when necessary.
E. Search and Rescue
• EMS and Fire are responsible for the coordination of the search and rescue phase of
a major event.
• Forensic personnel may be responsible for assisting in this phase of the event however
EMS has authority over all search and rescue efforts. F. Event Documentation/Evidence Collection
• Once search and rescue is completed, the objective will become documentation and evidence identification/collection.
• The Evidence Recovery Team will be responsible for this function.
• Crime scene guidelines and protocols will be followed unless deviations are
approved by Command staff.
• The Evidence Recovery Team will be supported by other teams including, but not
limited to, the photo/video team.
• Support staff may be called in from other teams depending on the extent of the
scene.
G. Outside Agency Assistance
• Any outside agency assistance will be authorized by Command staff.
• In a major event, the possibility of a Federal or State agency taking over the
investigation is highly possible.
.1 Once the investigation has been released to a Federal agency, it will be at that
agency’s discretion to utilize our assistance.
.2 The Division will assist that agency, however necessary, to conclude the
investigation.
H. Termination of a Major Event Call Out
• Termination of the major event call out will be determined by Command staff.
• Upon termination of the call out, it is the supervisors’ responsibility to ensure that
their Section returns to normal operations.

a. Audit Selection - In general, the Auditing Division selects which audits it will conduct prior to the year they are conducted. Each year, the Auditing Division issues a Notice requesting its staff and SBA program managers to submit audit suggestions for the following fiscal year. Division management officials consider these suggestions in developing the annual audit plan for the Auditing Division. In addition, the need for some audits may arise during the course of the year as a result of an allegation of wrongdoing; a request from a program manager; a request from the Inspector General, SBA Administrator, or other senior policy officials; or a contractor’s completion of a contract with SBA.

b. Survey - The auditors take a preliminary look at the program, operation or participant. They gather and evaluate information to determine the most significant problem areas and avoid unproductive work during the audit’s review phase. Auditors may not need to conduct surveys on standardized audits with pre-approved audit programs, e.g., an audit of a small business development center.

c. Developing the Audit Program - Upon completing the survey, the auditors determine which area(s) of the program or operations to review and develop the audit program. The audit program determines:
(1) The specific questions (objectives) the auditors will answer during the audit;
(2) The specific audit steps the auditors will complete to answer these questions; and
(3) The activities and time periods the audit will cover.
The Assistant Inspector General for Auditing approves each audit program prior to initiation of the audit; audit programs are generally not available to the public.

d. Review Phase - The auditors collect, analyze, interpret, and document such information, as necessary, to complete the audit objectives and the specific audit steps included in the audit program and to support the audit results.

e. Report Writing - The auditors write a draft report containing audit findings and the recommendations for correcting the deficiencies noted in these findings.

f. Incorporation of Management Comments - Prior to issuance of the report, the Auditing Division provides a draft version of the report to the auditee and responsible SBA management officials for review and comment. The auditors analyze any comments, modifying the report as necessary. The comments are generally included, verbatim, as appendices to the report. In the body of the report, the auditors:
(1) Summarize the comments;
(2) Discuss why the Auditing Division agrees or disagrees with any comments questioning the draft report; and
(3) Discuss what changes, if any, have been made to the report.

g. Report Issuance - The Assistant Inspector General for Auditing signs and distributes the report (see paragraph 3-3).

h. Management Decision and Action After Report Issuance - The SBA program manager to whom the report is addressed is responsible for responding to the audit report’s recommendations and informing the Auditing Division of his/her proposed decision. The management decision is recorded on SBA Form 1824, Recommendation Action Sheet. See SOP 20 35, Audit Followup System. The Auditing Division can either concur or non-concur with the management decision.
(1) Concur - Both parties indicate concurrence by signing the Recommendation Action Sheet. The SBA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer tracks the implementation of the management decision until final action is completed.
(2) Non-concur - The Auditing Division works with the responsible program manager to develop a management decision acceptable to both parties. If agreement cannot be reached, the Auditing Division has the option of escalating the decision to progressively higher management levels until resolution is reached. The Deputy Administrator is the final management level, and his/her decision is final. The Inspector General may report any disagreement in the OIG’s Semiannual Report to the Congress.
The Auditing Division tracks the status of management decisions until both parties concur, and reports on this status in the OIG’s Semiannual Report to the Congress. The Agency reports on the status of final actions in its Semiannual Management Report to the Congress.

B. Where to Apply

1. The CDC submits an original and one copy of the application to the SBA field office serving the proposed Area of Operations. If there is more than one field office serving the proposed Area of Operations, the CDC submits its application to the field office where the CDC will be headquartered. The field office will review the application and forward all SBA Forms 1081 and fingerprint cards or Electronic Fingerprint Submissions to OIG. If the application is complete and eligible, the field office will forward to the appropriate SBA official for a final decision:
a) The application;
b) Copies of SBA Forms 1081 with attachments;
c) A notation that the SBA Forms 1081 and fingerprint cards or Electronic Fingerprint Submission
have been forwarded to OIG; and
d) Its recommendation.

2. Decline at the Field Office: If the field office declines a CDC application, it will notify the CDC in writing outlining the reasons for decline and the CDC’s rights of appeal, with a copy to the appropriate SBA official. The CDC applicant has 60 days to send an appeal to the field office for action by the next higher authority.

3. Final Decision – SBA will send a letter to the CDC applicant notifying it of the decision with a copy to the appropriate SBA district director.

C. Probationary Period for a New CDC 13 CFR §120.812

3. SBA will determine permanent CDC status or an extension of probation, in part, based upon the CDC’s compliance with the certification and operational requirements in 120.820 through 120.830. Also, the CDC must have satisfactory SBA performance, as determined by SBA in its discretion. The CDC’s Risk Rating, among other factors, will be considered in determining satisfactory SBA performance. Other factors may include, but are not limited to, on-site review; examination assessments, historical performance measures (like default rate, purchase rate and loss rate), loan volume to the extent that it impacts performance measures, and other performance related measurements and information (such as contribution toward SBA mission).

4. SBA will consider failure to apply for permanent status before the end of the probationary period as a withdrawal from the 504 program. If the CDC withdraws, it must transfer all funded and/or approved loans to another CDC approved by SBA, including all related servicing fees.

5. The CDC must have appropriate personnel attend industry training in credit analysis, 504 packaging, closing and servicing within 1 year of certification.Computer Matching Program Procedures

What Procedures are Required by the Computer Matching Privacy Protection Act?

(11) The Comptroller General (CG) may have access to all records of a recipient or non-Federal agency that the CG deems necessary to monitor or verify compliance with the agreement.

b. Agreement specifications. A copy of each agreement described above will be provided to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the House Committee on Governmental Operations, and the public upon request.
(1) Agreements will be effective 30 days after the date a copy is provided.
(2) An agreement shall remain in effect only for a period, not to exceed 18 months, that the DIB determines is appropriate for its purpose, and the time necessary to conduct the matching program.
(3) Within 3 months prior to the expiration of an agreement, the DIB may, without additional review, renew the matching agreement for no more than 1 additional year if:
(a) The program will be conducted without any change; and
(b) Each party to the agreement certifies to the DIB in writing that the program complies with the agreement.

c. Verification. To protect an individual whose records are used in matching programs, no participant agency may suspend, terminate, reduce, or make a final denial of any financial assistance or payment under a Federal benefit program to the individual, or take adverse action against the individual as a result of information produced by matching programs, until the information has been independently verified.
(1) Independent verification requires separate investigation and confirmation of information used as a basis for an adverse action against an individual including, where applicable:
(a) The amount of the asset or income involved;
(b) Whether the individual actually has or had access to the asset or income for personal use; and
(c) The period(s) when the individual actually had the asset or income.

(b) Until the expiration of any notice period provided by the program's law or regulations, or 30 days, whichever is later. An opportunity to contest may be satisfied by notice, hearing, and appeal rights governing a Federal benefit program. The exercise of those rights shall not affect rights available under this paragraph.
(3) An agency may take appropriate action otherwise prohibited by paragraph 1.c.(2)(b) of this chapter if the agency determines that public health or safety may be adversely affected or significantly threatened during the notice period required by such paragraph.

d. Sanctions. Notwithstanding any other law, a source agency may not disclose a record from a system of records for a matching program to a recipient or non- Federal agency if the source agency has any reason to believe that the above requirements, or any matching agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph 1.b. of this chapter, or both, are not being met by the recipient agency. No source agency may renew a matching agreement unless:
(a) The recipient or non-Federal agency has certified it has complied with the provisions of that agreement; and
(b) The source agency believes the certification is accurate.

e. Data Integrity Board. Agencies that conduct or participate in matching programs must establish a DIB to oversee and coordinate the program. Members of the SBA DIB include senior officials designated by the Administrator, including the IG (who may not serve as Chair) and the Assistant Administrator for Hearings and Appeals, who is the senior official responsible for the implementation of the PA. The DIB must:
(1) Review, approve, and maintain all written agreements for receipt or disclosure of SBA records for matching programs;
(2) Review all matching programs in which the SBA has participated during the year; determine compliance with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, and agency agreements; and assess the costs and benefits of the programs;

(7) Review SBA record-keeping policies and practices for matching programs to ensure compliance; and
(8) Review and report on any SBA matching activities that are not matching programs.

f. Cost-benefit analysis. Except as provided in paragraphs e.(2) and (3) above, the DIB must not approve any written agreement for a matching program unless the SBA has submitted to the DIB a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed program demonstrating the cost-effectiveness. The DIB may waive these requirements if, consistent with OMB guidelines, a cost-benefit analysis is not required. An analysis is not required prior to the initial approval of a written agreement for a matching program that is specifically required by statute.

g. Disapproval of matching agreements. If a matching agreement is not approved by the DIB, any party to the agreement may appeal to OMB. OMB will notify the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Operations of the appeal.

(1) OMB may approve a matching agreement despite the disapproval of the DIB if OMB determines that:
(a) The matching program complies with all applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements;
(b) Adequate evidence exists that the matching agreement will be cost- effective; and
(c) The matching program is in the public interest.
(2) The decision of OMB to approve a matching agreement must not take effect until 30 days after it is reported to the committees described above.
(3) If the DIB and OMB disapprove a matching program proposed by the IG, the IG may report the disapproval to the Administrator and to Congress.

h. Reports. OMB will prepare a biennial report to Congress that consolidates information reported from the various DIBs. The report will detail the costs and benefits of matching programs conducted during the report period, and identify each waiver of the required submission of a cost-benefit analysis granted by a DIB, and the reasons for granting the waiver. In order to protect ongoing law enforcement or counter-intelligence operations, SBA may report non-matching activities on an aggregate basis.What is the SBA’s Privacy Act Appellate Procedure?

a. The PA Officer will consider all relevant material, including the System Manager’s decision, and the material submitted by the requesting individual. The PA Officer may consult with OGC for a legal opinion and other SBA officials who have relevant knowledge.

b. The PA Officer must issue a final decision no later than 30 working days after receipt of an appeal, unless the 30-day period is extended for good cause. If so, the PA Officer must notify the individual of the expected response date.

c. If the PA Officer denies access or amendment, he/she must:
(1) Notify the individual of the reason for the denial;
(2) Notify the individual of their right to judicial review;
(3) Allow the individual to file a concise statement explaining their reasons for disagreement if an amendment appeal is denied; and
(4) Mark the areas of dispute, include the individual’s statement of disagreement in the file, and if appropriate, a statement of why SBA refused to amend the record. The PA Officer must provide a copy of this material to prior recipients of the record.

d. If the PA Officer grants access or amendment to file:
(1) For access to a file, the PA Officer will notify the individual:
(a) that, unless the individual objects for good cause, the record will be mailed; or
(b) provide the time and place where the record may be reviewed.
(2) For amendment of a file, the PA Officer will promptly correct any portion of the record that the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The PA Officer must provide a copy of the amended record to prior recipients of the record.
e. Nothing in 5 U.S.C. § 552a shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.Open Procedure

Open Procedures are used where there is likely to be limited interest in an opportunity. In this case anyone interested in the contract will be invited to tender in order to ensure maximum competition (and therefore value for money).

The main points in the Open Procedure are:
- The Contract Notice/Invitation To Tender (ITT) is advertised by the buying organisation (this will clearly state that the contract is being let through the Open Procedure).

- Suppliers are expected to note interest in the contract and request the ITT documents.

- Suppliers will be issued with ITT documents within 6 days of their request. The Open Procedure allows for ITTs to be issued on request at any point prior to the date set for submission of tenders. When an ITT is issued near to the closing date, the supplier will be made aware that the submission date is imminent.

- The ITT documents should include:
1) Instructions to Tenderers e.g. timetable, submission deadline, e-tendering process,
2) Background and overview of the tendering and evaluation process
3) Terms and Conditions of the Contract which will apply to any resulting contract with the principle supplier
4) Specification and technical requirements
5) Response requirements
6) Quality Questionnaire
7) Pricing Schedule
8) Application Form of Tender
9) Acceptance of Terms and Conditions
10) For frameworks agreements the documents will include Mini Competition Guidance

- The closing date for the receipt of bids is generally no less than 52 days from the day after the date of dispatch of advert to OJEU. Reductions in timescale are available if a Prior Information Notice was issued or if the contract notice has been submitted electronically and gives immediate full and unrestricted access to the contract documents (for example, registered suppliers have full and unrestricted access to tender documents for contracts they note interest against on Public Contracts Scotland).

- If there is a justifiable reason to change the closing date, the new date will be notified to all tenderers. If at that point a supplier indicates that they have already submitted a tender then they should be given the opportunity to withdrawing their original tender and submit a revised one.

- Dialogue with buyers is possible but will be limited to requests for clarification and clarifications will be shared will all other interested bidders. Negotiation on price and other fundamental aspects which are likely to distort competition is prohibited.

- Tenderers may be invited to a meeting to discuss the ITT. The purpose of the meeting is to allow buyers and suppliers to clarify and highlight aspects of the ITT. A Suppliers' Meeting will not be necessary for every tender exercise.

- Once the procurement has commenced all clarification between potential suppliers and the Buying Public Body is carried out in a fair and transparent manner. For example, any question submitted by a supplier along with the answer provided by the Public Body must be anonymised and circulated to all of the suppliers involved in the process at least 6 days prior to the date set for tender return. Question and Answers are most easily handled through an electronic such as Public Contracts Scotland

- In a case where only one tender is received the Buyer will decide whether to restart the competition or to proceed as a Non-Competitive Action (NCA).

What do Suppliers need to do?

- Register on Public Contracts Scotland
- Formally note interest in the Contract
- Ensure you receive all the tender documents
- Ensure you can meet the deadlines (extensions are very rarely allowed)
- It is the responsibility of all suppliers to ensure that their bid is submitted in accordance with the rules of the competition and before the specified deadline. Non-conformant bids will be disqualified from the competition.THE SELECTION STAGE

General

A.2.1 The selection stage (under restricted, competitive dialogue and negotiated procedures)
produces a short list of the most suitable organisations from all those that expressed an interest in carrying out the contract. The selection stage of the process must be objective, fair, accountable and transparent. The criteria for selection must be established before inviting expressions of interest or placing advertisements, including those in OJEU. The criteria and any related weightings (e.g. scoring system) should be specified in the advertisement, and should be related to, and proportionate to, the subject matter of the contract.

A.2.2 The selection process in this guidance will meet these requirements. It consists of the following steps:
• establish:
- minimum, and where appropriate, maximum number of candidates to be selected
- selection criteria;
- weightings for selection criteria;
- thresholds for selection criteria, where appropriate; and
- a selection mechanism;
• invite expressions of interest/draw up long list; and
• draw up short list.

Selection criteria

A.2.3 Selection criteria should be based on information concerning the attributes of an organisation that fall under the headings “personal position”, “economic and financial standing” and “technical or professional ability” . They should be aimed at selecting the most suitable organisations, capable of carrying out the required work whilst taking account of the need to achieve VFM. They must not discriminate against or in favour of service providers in other Member States. Where the Regulations apply, care must be taken to ensure that the selection criteria are consistent with what is permitted under the Regulations and that the criteria (and their relative importance, e.g. any weightings or scoring system to be applied) appear in the advertisement.
A.2.4 Examples of selection criteria are given below. However, considerable care and judgement will be required to set appropriate and proportionate selection criteria for individual projects, making sure that they genuinely reflect the candidates ability to perform the contract (for example, not automatically excluding newly-established firms unable to submit 3 years evidence in respect of certain criteria):

Personal position
• any contractor, or any director or person who has power of representation, decision or control of the contractor, who has been convicted of an offence set out in regulation 23(1) of the Regulations should not be permitted to bid for contracts
• In addition, a contractor may be deemed as unsuitable for selection on grounds of, for example:
- bankruptcy;
- failure to pay taxes;
- serious misrepresentation;
- grave misconduct in the course of business; or
- convicted of a criminal offence in the conduct of business (not to be confused with
offences under regulation 23(1)).

Economic and financial standing (care must be exercised to ensure that no discrimination occurs by selecting contractors on the basis of turnover if all contractors meet any minimum standards set out in the advertisement)
• financial status; and
• insurance provisions.

Technical or professional ability
• resources;
- average number of staff and managers over previous 3 years;
- proportion of the contract to be subcontracted.
• skills;
- educational qualifications;
- evidence of membership of industry-recognised skills registration or accreditation
schemes for own and sub-contractor’s operatives (such as Construction Skills Certification Scheme for example), and commitment to workforce development initiatives such as Investors in People, Respect for People, Considerate Constructors Scheme, etc., where this is relevant to ability to perform the contract in question.
• efficiency;
- risk management;
- value management;
- capital, life cycle and whole life cost management;
- supply chain management and collaboration including partnering arrangements in
force with sub-contractors and suppliers.
• experience and past performance;
- list of works carried out over the past 5 years;
- references from other clients.
• reliability;
- health and safety management;
- rejected claims history.
• quality management;
• environmental management; and
• technical suitability for contract.

A.2.5 The selection criteria must be capable of being scored and audited. Client bodies will need to consider how each criterion can be scored and whether such scores are fair and accountable. Section 5 also sets out a number of health and safety matters which should be considered at the selection stage as part of the candidate’s appropriate skills, experience and resources.

Weightings for selection criteria

A.2.6 The relative importance of each criterion listed under the “technical or professional ability” heading can be established by giving it a percentage weighting such that the sum of all the weightings equals 100%. An example is at Table 1. It is provided for illustration only and is likely to require modification for specific contracts.

Quality threshold

A.2.7 For each criterion, client bodies will need to determine their minimum requirements for acceptability. Failure to meet such standards should preclude an organisation being considered further. Minimum standards for participation should not be set any higher than is necessary, so as not to unfairly disadvantage small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). There may also need to be an overall quality threshold (Table 1) for the criteria under the “technical or professional ability” heading.

A.2.8 Care needs to be taken when setting quality thresholds to ensure that they are set at levels representative of the minimum acceptable standards. If they are set unnecessarily high, there is a risk of excluding capable organisations that could offer better VFM, of unfairly disadvantaging SMEs and of breaching obligations relating to decisions being proportionate with reference to the subject matter of the contract.

Selection mechanism

A.2.9 Table 1 shows an example of a selection mechanism and demonstrates how the selection criteria and the weightings applied to them are used to evaluate each organisation and judge its suitability for carrying out the contract. The selection mechanism must be established before drawing up the long list or inviting expressions of interest, placing advertisements etc.

A.2.10 The example in Table 1 is intended to illustrate the principles involved and is likely to require modification for specific contracts/commissions. Items shown in italics will vary according to the project and client. It is prudent to draw up a mechanism for each contract and test it with dummy data to ensure it works as anticipated.
Invite expressions of interest

A.2.11 Where the contract value (making allowance for the aggregation rules) lies above the appropriate EU threshold (and for a consultancy commission also falls within Part A), it will normally be necessary to invite expressions of interest by placing a notice in OJEU.

A.2.12 Invitations for expressions of interest or advertisements, including those in OJEU, should include the following information:
• details of the information required from bidders to enable their evaluation (i.e. the selection criteria (when available) and the information required to demonstrate how each is met);
• whether variant bids will be accepted; and
• other information:
- intention to enter into teamworking or partnering arrangements; and
- details of incentives to be included in the contract.

A.2.13 For contracts that are not subject to the Regulations, invitations for expressions of interest should normally be advertised, particularly on the Public Contracts Scotland national advertising portal, to meet the obligation of regulation 8(21) of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006. Care must still be taken not to discriminate against organisations on the grounds of nationality or the Member State in which they are based (for example, requiring that a bidder is based in, or within a certain distance of, a particular locality would be open to legal challenge as being in breach of EU law).
A Staged Approach to Risk Assessment

The framework supports practitioners to take a staged approach to assessment, analysis and risk management and sets out a range of tasks and activities that can be undertaken within each stage. As noted previously, risk is dynamic and as such practitioners will often move between these stages as information and circumstances change. New information may also come to light that requires practitioners to revisit the assessment and revise their interventions with a family and reshape the Child’s Plan. The graphic below sets out this staged process and highlights the various tools that practitioners can use at each particular stage to support them in the process of assessing, analysing and managing needs/risks.

STAGE 1: Collection and Collation of Information
All assessment, no matter the service or circumstances, is based upon the gathering of relevant information from across all areas of a child and family’s life circumstances identified as having significance. Information is gathered from a range of sources around the three domains of the My World Triangle, and the Risk Framework supplements and further supports this process by setting out three sets of Risk Indicators – Generic, Matrix Related and Resistance Related. This allows practitioners to comprehensively cover generic aspects of risk as well as to actively consider particular aspects of vulnerability, resilience, adversity, protection and resistance within the three dimensions of the My World Triangle.

STAGE 2: Risk Analysis
Analysis is a key activity in assessment. Making sense of children’s lives and relationships is fundamental to understanding their well-being and safety. Risk analysis is the process of understanding what the information gathered is saying about the actual and potential needs of and risks to the child. Information gathering should be purposeful, systematic and organised in approach and practitioners must consistently ask themselves, “what is this information telling me”?

Key consideration needs to be given to the following:
- The abilities of the parent/carer to protect
- The known resilience and protective factors, particular to and around the child
that may help to better protect
- The impact of the identified risk factors on the child’s future safety
- The capacity of the parents to effect any necessary changes in the timeframe
commensurate with the child’s age and development

Analysis is a continuous process: it begins as information is gathered and organised and explores circumstances which are identified as having meaning and significance for the child’s safety and well-being. Analysis draws upon practitioner reasoning to make sense of circumstances and in this respect it can be deliberate, considered, formal, explicit and logical. However, as Eileen Munro (2005) noted, it can also draw upon the intuitive reasoning of the practitioners involved. Both approaches are acknowledged as having validity as part of a continnuum for analysing family circumstances and events, albeit that, where time and significance of decision making apply, the more deliberate approach is preferred. Analysis of the information gathered will then critically be used to inform professional interventions and any risk management strategy to be set out within the Child’s Plan.

STAGE 3: Risk Management
Clear assessment through focused, systematic information gathering and analysis will better inform the risk management strategy framed within the single Child’s Plan. The development of the Child’s Plan is key in defining the actions necessary to be undertaken by services and parent/carers, to satisfactorily address need and reduce risk. This should clearly state who is doing what, when, within what timescale, to achieve what outcome and for what purpose.

1 Overview
2 Grounds for divorce
3 File for divorce
4 Respond to a divorce petition
5 Apply for decree nisi
6 Apply for a decree absolute

1. Overview
You can get a divorce if you have been married at least a year and your relationship has permanently broken down.

You must have a marriage that is legally recognised in the UK, and have a permanent home in England or Wales.

There are 3 main steps to getting divorced:

1) File a divorce petition - you have to apply to the court for permission to divorce, and show reasons why you want the marriage to end.

2) Apply for a decree nisi - if your spouse agrees to the petition, you’ll get a document saying there’s no reason you can’t divorce.

3) Apply for a decree absolute - this legally ends your marriage - you need to wait 6 weeks after you get the decree nisi before you can apply.

Arrange your own divorce
You may be able to arrange your own divorce without involving solicitors if you agree on:

- the reasons for a divorce
- how you’ll look after any children
- how you’ll split up money, property and possessions

If you agree on these things beforehand, you won’t have to go to a court hearing, and the divorce paperwork should be fairly straightforward.

You can get mediation to help work out an agreement with your husband or wife about money, property or children. You may be able to get legal aid to help pay for mediation.

2. Grounds for divorce
You must show there are good reasons for ending your marriage. You can give 5 grounds for a divorce.

Adultery
Your husband or wife had sex with someone else of the opposite sex, and you can no longer bear to live with them.

You can’t give adultery as a reason if you lived with your husband or wife for 6 months after you found out about it.

Unreasonable behaviour
Your husband or wife behaved so badly that you can no longer bear to live with them.

This could include:

- physical violence
- verbal abuse, eg insults or threats
- drunkenness or drug-taking
- refusing to pay for housekeeping

Desertion
Your husband or wife has left you:

- without your agreement
- without a good reason
- to end your relationship
- for more than 2 years in the past 2.5 years

You can still claim desertion if you have lived together for up to a total of 6 months in this period.

You have lived apart for more than 2 years
You can get a divorce if you’ve lived apart for more than 2 years and both agree to the divorce.

Your husband or wife must agree in writing.

You have lived apart for more than 5 years
Living apart for more than 5 years is usually enough to get a divorce, even if your husband or wife disagrees with the divorce.

3. File for divorce
You need to fill in a divorce petition form to start a divorce.

You must include your:

- full name and address
- husband or wife’s full name and address
- marriage certificate - the original certificate or a copy from a register office

Include the names and dates of birth of any children (no matter how old they are).

If you name the person your husband or wife was unfaithful with, they will get copies of the paperwork.

Pay the court fee
You will have to pay a £410 court fee to start a divorce.

You may be able to get help with court fees if you’re on benefits or a low income.

Send the forms
Once you have filled in the forms:

- send 2 copies of the divorce petition form to the court (3 if you named someone your husband or wife had an affair with)
- keep your own copies

Where to send the forms
Send the forms to your nearest divorce court.

4. Respond to a divorce petition
If your husband or wife has started divorce proceedings against you, the court will send you a ‘divorce petition’.

You will also get:

- a notice of proceedings form
- an acknowledgment of service form

Keep the notice of proceedings form, which tells you the case number and what you should do next.

You need to respond by filling in the acknowledgment of service form.

If you don’t respond within 21 days, your husband or wife can continue with the divorce as if you’ve agreed.

Agree with the divorce
To agree with the divorce petition, fill in and return the acknowledgment of service form to the court within 8 days, and the divorce will go ahead.

Disagree with the divorce
To disagree with the divorce petition fill in the acknowledgment of service form and return it within 8 days. Fill in the part that says you’re defending the divorce.

The court will send copies to your husband or wife.

After you return the form, you have up to 21 days to say why you are defending the divorce. This is called ‘giving an answer’.

To do this, fill in the answer to a divorce petition.

You may have to pay a £245 court fee.

Start your own divorce proceedings
After receiving a divorce petition you may then decide to start your own divorce against your husband or wife - eg if you have evidence of their adultery or unreasonable behaviour. To do this, fill in a divorce petition form.

You may have to pay a £410 court fee.

Court hearing
When a divorce is defended or both sides file divorce petitions, the court will usually hold a hearing to discuss the case.

You and your husband or wife will usually have to attend to try to come to an agreement over the divorce.

Get legal advice if there’s going to be a court hearing.

5. Apply for decree nisi
You can apply for a decree nisi if your husband or wife doesn’t defend your divorce petition.

A decree nisi is a document that says that the court doesn’t see any reason why you can’t divorce.

If your husband or wife doesn’t agree to the divorce, you can still apply for a decree nisi. However, you’ll have to go to a hearing at the court to discuss the case, where a judge will decide whether to grant you a decree nisi.

Fill in application form
To get a decree nisi, fill in the application for a decree nisi.

If your husband or wife is defending the case, fill in section B of the form, saying you want a ‘case management hearing’ before the judge.

You must also fill in a statement confirming that what you said in your divorce petition is true.

There are 5 statement forms - use the one that covers the grounds you’ve given for your divorce:

- adultery statement
- unreasonable behaviour statement
- desertion statement
- 2 years’ separation statement
- 5 years’ separation statement

Attach a copy of your husband or wife’s response to the divorce petition.

Getting a decree nisi
If the judge agrees, the court will send you and your husband or wife:

a certificate of entitlement to a decree
a decree nisi
After 6 weeks you can apply for a ‘decree absolute’ to end the marriage.

Your application is rejected
You may be sent a ‘notice of refusal of judge’s certificate’ form, saying why you can’t divorce.

The form will tell you what to do next. The judge may want more information in writing, or you may have to go to a court hearing.

Get legal advice if there is going to be a court hearing: find a legal adviser.

6. Apply for a decree absolute
The decree absolute is the legal document that ends your marriage.

You need to wait at least 6 weeks after the date of the decree nisi before you can apply for a decree absolute.

The delay gives you a chance to discuss finances and other issues with your husband or wife before the marriage comes to an end.

Apply within 12 months of getting the decree nisi - otherwise you will have to explain the delay to the court.

Fill in application form
To apply for a decree absolute, fill in the notice of application for decree nisi to be made absolute form.

A decree absolute costs £45. This fee won’t apply if you started your divorce after 1 July 2013, as it’s now part of the fee for starting the divorce.

If your husband or wife started the divorce
If your husband or wife started the divorce, but they haven’t applied for a decree absolute, you can apply.

You’ll have to wait an extra 3 months, on top of the standard 6-week delay, before you can do this.

To apply, fill in an application notice form.

You’ll have to pay a £155 fee and go to a court hearing with your husband or wife.

Getting the decree absolute
The court will check that:

- time limits have been met
- there are no other reasons not to grant the divorce

The court will then send you both a decree absolute.

Once you get the decree absolute, you are divorced, no longer married and free to marry again if you wish.

Keep the decree absolute safe - you will need to show it if you remarry or to prove your marital status.

Legislative process: taking a Bill through Parliament

An overview of the process by which Bills become law.

A Bill is a proposed law which is introduced into Parliament. Once a Bill has been debated and then approved by each House of Parliament, and has received Royal Assent, it becomes law and is known as an Act.

Any Member of Parliament can introduce a Bill. Some Bills represent agreed government policy, and these are introduced into Parliament by ministers. Other Bills are known as Private Member’s Bills, or (in the House of Lords) private peer’s Bills.

This guide is about Bills which affect the general law of the land. Special Parliamentary procedures apply to Bills which apply only to particular people or places, and the government has little or no involvement in this type of legislation.

Bills and Acts are often referred to as primary legislation. An Act may delegate power to a government minister to make orders, regulations or rules. These are known as secondary (or subordinate) legislation.

Legislation can be found online at legislation.gov.uk.

The decision to legislate
For each session of Parliament, the government will have a legislative programme, which is a plan of the Bills that it will ask Parliament to consider in that session (the period between elections is divided up into sessions, and each of those sessions lasts about a year). Other Bills may be passed each session that are not part of the legislative programme. These may for example be emergency Bills required to deal with a particular issue that has arisen, or they may be private member’s Bills, introduced by a member who is not a part of the government.

If a government department has a proposal for a Bill that it wants to be included in the legislative programme for a session, it must submit a bid for the Bill to the Parliamentary Business and Legislation (PBL) Committee of the Cabinet. The bid will usually be needed about a year before the beginning of the session in question. PBL Committee will consider all of the bids for that session and make a recommendation to Cabinet about the provisional content of the programme.

In considering whether to recommend that a Bill should be given a provisional slot, PBL Committee will consider factors such as the need for the Bill (and whether a similar outcome can be achieved without legislation), its relationship to the political priorities of the Government, the progress that has been made in working up the proposals for the Bill and whether the Bill has been published in draft for consultation.

Once the provisional programme has been agreed by Cabinet, PBL Committee will review it in the lead-up to the beginning of the session. About a month before the start of the session the Cabinet will finalise the programme. This will be announced in the Queen’s Speech at the state opening of Parliament, which begins the session.

The policy contained in the Bill will also need agreement from the appropriate policy committee of the Cabinet.

Preparation of the Bill
If a Bill is given a slot in the legislative programme, the department concerned will create a Bill team to co-ordinate its preparation and passage through Parliament. This will consist of a Bill manager and other officials working on the Bill. The other key players in the department will be the officials with lead responsibility for the policies in the Bill and the department’s legal advisers.

The policy officials will prepare policy instructions for the departmental lawyers. These instructions will in turn form the basis of instructions to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to draft the Bill. Instructions to counsel will set out the background and relevant current law and explain the changes in the law to be brought about by the Bill.

There will usually be at least two counsel assigned to the Bill, and larger Bills may well have more drafters. They will analyse the instructions and may have questions that need to be answered before drafting can begin. Once the drafters feel they have a clear idea of the policy, they will send drafts to the relevant departmental lawyer. The lawyer will discuss the drafts with the relevant policy officials and send comments back.

The first draft of a clause or set of clauses for a topic is rarely the final word on that topic, and the process of drafting and commenting on drafts will continue until the drafters and the department are happy that the right result has been achieved by the draft in the clearest possible way.

Some provisions in a Bill may require the agreement of a department other than the one sponsoring the Bill. For example, the Ministry of Justice’s criminal offences gateway requires all proposals for the creation of new offences in England and Wales to be cleared by the Secretary of State for Justice.

If the provisions of the Bill apply to Wales or extend to Scotland or Northern Ireland, it may be necessary for the department or the drafter to consult the devolved administration in the relevant part of the UK. Provisions in a Bill which relate to matters that have been devolved to the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Parliament or the Northern Ireland Assembly will usually need the consent of that body.

Towards introduction
Although a Bill may have a slot in the legislative programme, it cannot be introduced until it has been specifically cleared for introduction by a meeting of PBL Committee.

The Committee will consider the final (or near-final) draft of the Bill together with a range of other documents. Some of these, like the Explanatory Notes, will be published alongside the Bill after introduction. Others, like the department’s Parliamentary Handling Strategy and its assessment of the relationship between the Bill and the European Convention on Human Rights, are for the Committee’s consideration only.

If PBL Committee is satisfied that the Bill is ready and that other legal and procedural issues have been resolved, it will approve its introduction subject to any necessary minor and drafting changes. The Committee will also decide whether the Bill should start in the House of Commons or the House of Lords (see further below).

Some Bills are published in draft for consultation before introduction. The Bill may then go through a process of pre-legislative scrutiny where it is considered by a Parliamentary committee or committees. The committee will take evidence and make recommendations to the Government on the Bill. These recommendations, together with the consultation responses from members of the public, may mean that elements of the Bill are modified before introduction. Publication of a Bill in draft still needs the agreement of PBL Committee, although it will normally be cleared by correspondence rather than at a meeting.

Parliamentary Stages
Most Bills can begin either in the House of Commons or in the House of Lords. The Government will make this decision based on the need to make sure each House has a balanced programme of legislation to consider each session. However, certain Bills must start in the Commons, such as a Bill whose main aim is the imposition of taxation (the annual Finance Bill is an example of this). Bills of major constitutional importance also conventionally start in the Commons.

Most Bills will need to go through the following stages in each House before becoming law (what is said below applies to either House except where indicated).

First reading
This is a purely formal stage, and there is no debate on the Bill.

Second reading
This is a debate on the main principles of the Bill, held in the chamber. A Government minister will open the debate by setting out the case for the Bill and explaining its provisions. The Opposition will respond and then other members are free to discuss it. The Government will close the debate by responding to the points made. No amendments can be made to the text of the Bill at this stage, although members may give an idea of the changes they will be proposing at later stages. At the end of the debate the House will vote on the Bill. If the vote is lost by the Government, the Bill cannot proceed any further, though it is rare for a Government Bill to be defeated at this stage.

Committee stage
This is a line-by-line consideration of the detail of the Bill. In the Commons this process may be carried out by a specially convened committee of MPs (a Public Bill Committee) that reflects the strength of the parties in the House as a whole. Alternatively committee stage may be taken in the chamber (in which case it is called Committee of the Whole House). In the Lords the committee stage will take place in the chamber or elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster; either way any peer can participate.

A Public Bill Committee in the Commons can take oral and written evidence on the Bill. In either House the Committee will decide whether each clause of the Bill should remain in it, and will consider any amendments tabled by the Government or other members.

The amendments tabled may propose changes to the existing provisions of the Bill or may involve adding wholly new material. However, there are limits to what can be added to a particular Bill, as the amendments must be sufficiently close to its subject matter when introduced.

Government amendments to Bills (in Committee or at other stages: see below) may be changes to make sure the Bill works as intended, may give effect to new policy or may be concessionary amendments to ease the handling of the Bill. Amendments in the last category will respond to points made at an earlier stage or will have been tabled to avoid a Government defeat at the stage in question. Unless the amendments are purely technical in their effect, they will need the agreement of PBL Committee before tabling, and substantial changes in policy will need policy clearance too.

Report stage
In both Houses this stage takes place in the chamber. Only amendments are discussed, so if none are tabled this will be a purely formal stage. As in Committee the amendments may change what is in the Bill already or may involve new provisions being added.

Report stage is also referred to as Consideration in the Commons.

Third reading
In the Commons this is another general discussion of the Bill which invariably takes place immediately after Report. No amendments are possible. In the Lords, Third Reading will take place on a later day, and tidying up amendments can be tabled.

Later stages
Both Houses must agree on the text of a Bill before it can become an Act. This means that if the Bill is amended in the second House, it must return to the first House for those amendments to be considered. The first House can reject the amendments, make changes to them or suggest alternatives. A Bill may move backwards and forwards between the two Houses before agreement is reached, so this stage is sometimes called “ping pong”.

The time taken to go through all these stages depends on the length of the Bill, how controversial it is and whether it needs to be passed particularly quickly. An emergency Bill may be passed in a matter of days, whereas a larger Bill may be introduced at the beginning of the session and only passed at the end a year later.

Royal Assent and beyond
A Bill that has been passed by both Houses becomes law once it has been given Royal Assent and this has been signified to Parliament. It will then become an Act. Even then the Act may not have any practical effect until later on. Most provisions in an Act will either come into operation within a set period after Royal Assent (commonly two months later) or at a time fixed by the government. This gives the government and those people who are directly affected by the Act time to plan accordingly. The government may need to fill in some of the details of the new scheme by making orders or regulations under powers contained in the Act, for example to deal with procedural matters.

Three to five years after a Bill has been passed, the department responsible for an Act will normally review how it has worked in practice and submit an assessment of this to the relevant Commons departmental committee. The committee will then decide whether it wants to carry out a fuller post-legislative enquiry into the Act.The Legislative Process

How Are Laws Made?

Laws begin as ideas. First, a representative sponsors a bill. The bill is then assigned to a committee for study. If released by the committee, the bill is put on a calendar to be voted on, debated or amended. If the bill passes by simple majority (218 of 435), the bill moves to the Senate. In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on. Again, a simple majority (51 of 100) passes the bill. Finally, a conference committee made of House and Senate members works out any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The resulting bill returns to the House and Senate for final approval. The Government Printing Office prints the revised bill in a process called enrolling. The President has 10 days to sign or veto the enrolled bill.

Forms of Congressional Action

The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a proposal in one of four principal forms: the bill, the joint resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution.

Bills
A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether permanent or temporary, general or special, public or private. A bill originating in the House of Representatives is designated by the letters “H.R.”, signifying “House of Representatives”, followed by a number that it retains throughout all its parliamentary stages. Bills are presented to the President for action when approved in identical form by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Joint Resolutions
Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. There is little practical difference between a bill and a joint resolution. Both are subject to the same procedure, except for a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution. On approval of such a resolution by two-thirds of both the House and Senate, it is sent directly to the Administrator of General Services for submission to the individual states for ratification. It is not presented to the President for approval. A joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives is designated “H.J.Res.” followed by its individual number. Joint resolutions become law in the same manner as bills.

Concurrent Resolutions
Matters affecting the operations of both the House of Representatives and Senate are usually initiated by means of concurrent resolutions. A concurrent resolution originating in the House of Representatives is designated “H.Con.Res.” followed by its individual number. On approval by both the House of Representatives and Senate, they are signed by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate. They are not presented to the President for action.

Simple Resolutions
A matter concerning the operation of either the House of Representatives or Senate alone is initiated by a simple resolution. A resolution affecting the House of Representatives is designated “H.Res.” followed by its number. They are not presented to the President for action.

For more information on bills and resolutions see Forms of Congressional Action in How Our Laws Are Made

Introduction and Referral to Committee

Any member in the House of Representatives may introduce a bill at any time while the House is in session by simply placing it in the “hopper” at the side of the Clerk's desk in the House Chamber. The sponsor's signature must appear on the bill. A public bill may have an unlimited number of co-sponsoring members. The bill is assigned its legislative number by the Clerk and referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker, with the assistance of the Parliamentarian. The bill is then printed in its introduced form, which you can read in Bill Text.
An important phase of the legislative process is the action taken by committees. It is during committee action that the most intense consideration is given to the proposed measures; this is also the time when the people are given the opportunity to be heard. Each piece of legislation is referred to the committee that has jurisdiction over the area affected by the measure. 
For more information on this step of the legislative process see Introduction and Reference to Committee of How Our Laws Are Made.

Consideration by Committee

Public Hearings and Markup Sessions
Usually the first step in this process is a public hearing, where the committee members hear witnesses representing various viewpoints on the measure. Each committee makes public the date, place and subject of any hearing it conducts. The committee meetings scheduled for today are available along with other House Schedules. Public announcements are also published in the Daily Digest portion of the Congressional Record.

A transcript of the testimony taken at a hearing is made available for inspection in the committee office, and frequently the complete transcript is printed and distributed by the committee.

After hearings are completed, the bill is considered in a session that is popularly known as the “mark-up” session. Members of the committee study the viewpoints presented in detail. Amendments may be offered to the bill, and the committee members vote to accept or reject these changes.

This process can take place at either the subcommittee level or the full committee level, or at both. Hearings and markup sessions are status steps noted in the Legislative Action portion of Bill Status.

Committee Action
At the conclusion of deliberation, a vote of committee or subcommittee members is taken to determine what action to take on the measure. It can be reported, with or without amendment, or tabled, which means no further action on it will occur. If the committee has approved extensive amendments, they may decide to report a new bill incorporating all the amendments. This is known as a “clean bill”, which will have a new number. Votes in committee can be found in Committee Votes. 
If the committee votes to report a bill, the Committee Report is written. This report describes the purpose and scope of the measure and the reasons for recommended approval. House Report numbers are prefixed with “H.Rpt.” and then a number indicating the Congress (currently 107).

For more information on bills and resolutions see Consideration by Committee in How Our Laws Are Made.

House Floor Consideration

Consideration of a measure by the full House can be a simple or very complex operation. In general a measure is ready for consideration by the full House after it has been reported by a committee. Under certain circumstances, it may be brought to the Floor directly.

The consideration of a measure may be governed by a “rule”. A rule is itself a simple resolution, which must be passed by the House, that sets out the particulars of debate for a specific bill—how much time will be allowed for debate, whether amendments can be offered, and other matters.

Debate time for a measure is normally divided between proponents and opponents. Each side yields time to those members who wish to speak on the bill. When amendments are offered, these are also debated and voted upon. If the House is in session today, you can see a summary of Current House Floor Proceedings.

After all debate is concluded and amendments decided upon, the House is ready to vote on final passage. In some cases, a vote to “recommit” the bill to committee is requested. This is usually an effort by opponents to change some portion or table the measure. If the attempt to recommit fails, a vote on final passage is ordered.

Votes on final passage, as well as all other votes in the House, may be taken by the electronic voting system which registers each individual member's response. These votes are referred to as Yea/Nay votes or recorded votes, and are available in House Votes by bill number, roll call vote number or words describing the reason for the vote.
Votes in the House may also be by voice vote, and no record of individual responses is available.

Senate Action

After a measure passes in the House, it goes to the Senate for consideration. A bill must pass both bodies in the same form before it can be presented to the President for signature into law.

Resolving Differences
If the Senate changes the language of the measure, it must return to the House for concurrence or additional changes. This back-and-forth negotiation may occur on the House floor, with the House accepting or rejecting Senate amendments or complete Senate text. Often a conference committee will be appointed with both House and Senate members. This group will resolve the differences in committee and report the identical measure back to both bodies for a vote. Conference committees also issue reports outlining the final version of the bill.

Consideration by the President

After a measure has been passed in identical form by both the House and Senate, it is considered “enrolled”. It is sent to the President who may sign the measure into law, veto it and return it to Congress, let it become law without signature, or at the end of a session, pocket-veto it.Submission of Votes to the Secretary


a. Commissioners select the appropriate expression of their position and mark the vote sheet accordingly ("Approved," “Disapproved," "Abstain," or "Not Participating").

b. Commissioners may also use the vote sheet to propose revisions to any course of action discussed in the paper, to propose a course of action not discussed in the paper, or to record comments on the issue.

c. Commissioners' staff fill out the electronic vote sheet, attach any comments, mark the sheet with /RAJ to denote that the Commissioner has signed, and e-mail to SECY and other Commissioner offices by responding to the e-mail 'from SECY which forwarded the blank vote sheet. SECY will then forward the electronic vote to OGC, EDO, CFO, and Commission-level offices as appropriate. In the case of hand written remarks or edits in the vote, the edits should be digitally scanned and electronically distributed with the electronic vote, if possible. If not possible, the original and 9 hard copies should be provided to SECY for distribution. Similarly, votes containing Classified or Safeguards Information cannot be transmitted electronically and hard copies need to be delivered to SECY for further distribution to the other Commissioners and appropriate offices.


d. Commissioners' staff forward the original signed paper copies of completed votes to the Secretary as soon as they are available and promptly enter the vote in the Commission's on-line automated vote tracking system maintained by SECY.

e. Further distribution of vote sheets within the staff is permissible upon issuance of the vote, but distribution outside the agency is permissible only after the final collegial decision is recorded by the Secretary in an SRM to the action office and the votes have been released to the public. For votes that are not made publicly available, specific permission of each Commissioner is required prior to distribution of his or her own vote outside the NRC. Staff actions are not to be based upon individual Commissioner votes; the staff's actions are controlled by a majority vote of the Commission as directed in the SRM when issued. SECY shall promptly transmit to the Commission any comments that a Commission-level or staff office submits to SECY. Nothing in this section precludes a Commissioner from releasing his/her own vote
outside of the agency at any time, as long as the vote does not contain Classified, Safeguards Information, or other sensitive information.

f. If a Commissioner proposes modifications to the course of action recommended in the paper, or proposes revisions to a document on which voting is taking place, other Commissioners may indicate in their vote their agreement/disagreement with the proposed changes. SECY transmits all votes/comments to other Commissioners and determines, through the SRM process and discussions with Commissioner offices, whether individual modifications to the initial proposal receive support by a majority of the
Commission.

g. The Office of the Secretary will handle the release of the SRM and CVR, which includes individual Commissioner votes, as a unit, based upon the releasibility of the SECY paper. As a matter of collegiality, a Commissioner should inform SECY and his or her fellow Commissioners promptly if he or she makes a decision to release his or her vote prior to release of the SRM and CVR by SECY. SECY will then inform appropriate staff offices.REQUEST FOR ANALYSIS

Scope

This chapter establishes guidelines for receiving request for analysis.

Responsibilities

1. Each person requesting analysis should submit their request using the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) Pre-Log system.
2. Other methods of requesting analysis are admissible in cases where the requestor does not have access to the Pre-Log system.
3. Employees will ensure that the requests received are handled according to the following guidelines.

Practices

1. The majority of requests are received through the LIMS.

2. Each supervisor will assign the case as per section SOP.

3. All analysts are responsible for coordinating requests with other sections to ensure that a logical progression of examination is followed, so that one analysis does not interfere, or preclude other disciplines’ subsequent analyses

4. In any case in which the progression is questionable, the section supervisors of the respective sections will be consulted.

5. Request Accompanied by Evidence
A. All evidence submitted by Departmental personnel will be first submitted to the Evidence
Control Section.
B. Each person requesting analysis should submit their request using the Laboratory
Information Management System (LIMS) Pre-Log system.

6. The following types of cases will be considered appropriate for DNA analysis: A. Homicide and Attempted Homicide
B. Sexual Assault
C. Aggravated Offenses
D. Offenses where blood appears to be present or an item is found at the scene that was believed to be left by the perpetrator.
E. Threatening Correspondence
F. Other types of cases with approval from the DNA Section Supervisor.

7. Request from Outside Agencies
A. Before evidence or a request is accepted from an outside agency, the responsible
section supervisor or Division Manager should approve the acceptance of the request. This approval should be in advance, may be verbal and must be documented in the case file.
B. Once approved, the request will be accepted through LIMS. The agency code and the agency’s incident number will be used in LIMS as identifiers.
• Creating an “agency assist” incident number in Versadex is not necessary.
C. Evidence to be returned to the outside agency will be entered directly into LIMS and not initially entered into Versadex or submitted to the Evidence Control Section.
D. It is the section supervisor’s discretion on the priority of the request and the time frame in which the request will be completed.

8. Request for Reanalysis
Any reanalysis of evidence must be approved by the section supervisor or their designee prior to analysis.4. Applying for HDEC review

Introduction 
The Government’s response to the Health Committee’s clinical trials inquiry requires that applications to HDECs be able to be made online by 1 July 2012, and that researchers be able to ask that an application be reviewed by the HDEC nearest to them (rather than being allocated for review as soon as possible by any HDEC).
This section addresses these requirements. It also contains basic administrative rules relating to: 
•	how to apply for HDEC review 
•	who may apply for HDEC review
•	validation of new applications and substantial amendments by the HDEC secretariat.  

Key changes to this section following consultation include:
•	requiring applicants for HDEC review to be based in New Zealand
•	aligning HDEC terminology with that used in international GCP guidelines (for example using the term ‘co-ordinating investigator’ instead of ‘principal investigator’) 
•	clarifying that letters from reviewing bodies may constitute evidence of favourable peer review.


36.	Applications for HDEC review must be submitted through the HDECs’ electronic submission system. Applications and associated documents submitted in hard copy will not be accepted or acknowledged without prior agreement.  

37.	Applications for HDEC review of new applications and substantial amendments must be submitted or authorised by the co-ordinating investigator (CI) of the study in question, who may delegate responsibility for completing the application form and uploading study documents to other members of the study team at their discretion.

38.	The CI for a study must be professionally based, in whole or in part, in New Zealand. In the case of international studies, a local investigator should be nominated as the CI for the New Zealand arm of the study.

39.	Only one application may be submitted in relation to a study, including, generally, those that entail separate protocols governing sub-studies in addition to the main study. Applicants who intend to conduct related studies that are substantially similar to each other (for instance, studies that involve the administration of the same intervention for different indications) should contact the HDEC secretariat prior to submission to discuss how best to proceed. 

40.	Where an application will be reviewed by the full review pathway, the applicant may indicate at the time of submission that they would prefer their application to be considered by the closest possible HDEC (that is, the HDEC that meets closest to the address given by the CI in the application). Where such a preference has not been indicated, applications will be allocated for review to the next available HDEC meeting.  
Validation of new applications

41.	HDECs must assign all new applications and substantial amendments a unique identifier (an ‘HDEC reference number’) upon submission. The secretariat must then validate applications before assigning them to an HDEC for review.

42.	The HDEC secretariat may validate a new application only if:
42.1.	the application is within the scope of HDEC review, and
42.2.	the application is not similar enough to another application that it would be more appropriate for a single application to be made in respect of both studies, or for the application to be dealt with as a substantial amendment to an approved study, and
42.3.	all relevant questions in the application form have been answered in a manner that is reasonably likely to allow the HDEC to make a final decision on the application the first time it is considered, and
42.4.	the application is accompanied by the following mandatory documents:
42.4.1.	a study protocol 
42.4.2.	a brief CV for the CI
42.4.3.	in the case of studies that do not involve a new medicine, evidence of favourable peer review 
42.4.4.	in the case of studies involving a new medicine, an investigator’s brochure
42.4.5.	in the case of studies involving participants, a participation information sheet and consent form
42.4.6.	in the case of studies involving the administration of surveys or questionnaires, copies of the surveys or questionnaires 
42.4.7.	in the case of ‘commercially sponsored’ studies (see section 9), evidence of the insurance held by the study sponsor and evidence of the professional indemnity held by the CI
42.4.8.	in the case of studies where a previous application for the same study (or a substantially similar study) has been declined by an HDEC, a copy of the letter from the HDEC declining the previous application and a covering letter from the CI explaining how the new application addresses the reasons given by the HDEC to decline.

43.	Applicants may attach other documents to their application at their discretion.  This should normally include other written information to be provided to participants in the study. However, it is not necessary to submit all written information to be provided to participants;  applicants should use common sense in deciding whether a document is likely to be relevant to the HDEC in making its decision, and may seek advice from the HDECs in case of doubt.

44.	Valid applications should be assigned for HDEC review within three calendar days of their being submitted.   The CI should be informed of this and given details of:
44.1.	the date on which the 15- or 35-day review clock for a final decision begins
44.2.	the application’s HDEC reference number 
44.3.	whether the application is to be reviewed through the full or expedited review pathway
44.4.	the name and membership of the HDEC that will review the application.

45.	If the application is to be reviewed through the full review pathway, the HDEC should also give the CI details of:
45.1.	the date, time and venue of the meeting at which it is to consider the application 
45.2.	the time slot reserved for discussion of the application
45.3.	how to attend the meeting, in person or by teleconference.

46.	If an application does not meet the criteria for validation, the secretariat should advise the applicant of this, giving reasons. The applicant may then complete and resubmit the application.

47.	Once validated, the HDEC may invalidate or assign the application to another review pathway only with the prior agreement of the applicant.  

48.	Where an HDEC subsequently reassigns a validated application to another review pathway, the review clock for the new pathway starts from the date on which the application was submitted, not the date on which the application was reassigned.
Withdrawal of applications

49.	Applicants may withdraw applications for HDEC review at any time. In this case, the secretariat should confirm withdrawal formally as soon as possible. Resubmission of an application that has been withdrawn is considered as a separate application and given a new HDEC reference number.
Changes not able to be made between submission and approval

50.	Applicants may not make changes to an application between submission and approval, and may not submit amendments or other “post-approval” items during this period.

Formal second opinion procedure

1.35 The formal second opinion (FSO) procedure is an important part of ensuring that OSD maintains high standards of assessment decision-making. It is shown in Figure 1 and described below.

1.36 The FSO procedure should be completed within two weeks and in any case by the date by which an acceptance decision has to be made. OMs shall ensure that the highest priority is given to providing sufficient resource when it is needed.

Purpose of an FSO

1.37 FSO is mainly intended for those instances where the decision on case acceptance is finely balanced, or where there has been a failure to resolve differences of professional view between a topic team and an IMT. The aim is to provide an independent second view on the issue(s) at stake, to assist the OM making the acceptance decision. This is done by reviewing the arguments used by those involved and seeking additional views from others who have had no involvement so far. It is not the FSO's function to make the decision.

FSO Procedure

1.38 Only the OM responsible for making the acceptance decision may initiate the FSO procedure. All relevant OMs shall be consulted beforehand.

1.39 An OM who has had no direct involvement with the assessment of the case in question shall undertake the FSO process. This person is the 'FSO OM' and shall be commissioned by the OM initiating the FSO.

1.40 The FSO OM shall, as appropriate, enlist the assistance of:
a. a case manager who has had no direct involvement in the assessment of the case,
b. an appropriate topic specialist from OSD or another part of HSE who has had no direct involvement in the assessment of the case,
c. a person to act as secretary,
d. an adviser from the Legal and Operational Strategy Team (if necessary).

1.41 The selection should be made with care, and be agreed by the OMs involved in the case assessment.

1.42 The OM invoking the FSO shall initiate it by a case note to the CM, copied to the other OM involved and to the HoD. This shall be done as early as possible in the overall assessment process.

1.43 The OM requesting the FSO, assisted by the SCC, shall provide information as follows:
1. the name and COIN number of the case,
2. where the purpose of the FSO is to resolve a difference of professional view,
the case notes relevant to attempts to resolve the issue,
3. where the purpose of the FSO is to reach a decision on cases where
acceptance is finely balanced, the relevant case notes, issue notes and duty
holder responses,
4. a summary of the issue(s) involved and how they have arisen,
5. the date by which a decision on the way forward must be taken,
6. the name of someone who can supply copies of all of the information
considered by the assessment team.

1.44 The DCM and SCC shall supply copies of relevant information considered by the assessment team to the FSO OM.

1.45 Where an FSO is invoked as a result of a difference of professional view, the FSO OM shall consider:
a. the arguments of each party, as set out in the written material submitted to the FSO,
b. any necessary oral clarification from document authors, and
c. information and advice provided by staff enlisted to assist the process.
The OM shall then form a view on the line that OSD should take.

1.46 It is not the role of the FSO to resolve the differences. However if it becomes apparent that the differences can be resolved, the FSO OM shall try to secure a resolution by consulting the parties involved. If resolution is achieved then a report shall be sent by case note to the OMs involved and the CM, and action taken as in paragraph 1.22 above.

1.47 Where the purpose of the FSO is to assist the decision maker, the arguments
regarding acceptance being finely balanced, the FSO OM shall consider:
a. the relevant information in the case [and, where appropriate, information provided in response to issue notes],
b. the relevant case assessment reports, and
c. any other information which either OSD or the duty holder might use to
support their cases in a non-acceptance review by the Executive, or in an appeal to the Secretary of State.
The FSO OM shall use the information to consider if the acceptance criteria are met.

1.48 The FSO OM shall prepare a concise report highlighting:
a. the information that was reviewed,
b. those who assisted in the FSO process,
c. the formal second opinion, and the reasons for it, and
d. aspects of the information that might be strengthened by further OSD activity.

1.49 If the FSO was invoked as a result of a difference of professional view then the FSO
OM shall consult the parties involved before finalising the report.

1.50 The opinion shall be submitted by case note to the OM requesting the FSO, and copied to any other OM involved, at the earliest possible date, and by the date by which a decision on the way forward must be taken.

1.51 The OM responsible for the acceptance decision shall note the outcome of the FSO when making the decision, and may consult the CM and the topic OM.

1.52 If any OM has concerns about the FSO, the OM making the acceptance decision shall advise the HoD once the decision has been made.
FSO Records

1.53 The DCM shall include a summary of the issue(s), the FSO report and the decision made in the case close out report.APPENDIX 3: THE INTERVENTION PROCESS 

Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:


• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.Section 9 Review of decisions eligible for appeal

Introduction

9.1 Under the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 2005 (SCR), Regulation 24(1) any person who is aggrieved by a decision by HSE may appeal to the Secretary of State. The relevant decisions relate to:

- a finding of fact by HSE,
- non-acceptance of a Safety Case,
- direction to prepare a Safety Case revision,
- non-acceptance of a revision to a Safety Case,
- suspension of a Safety Case,
- not lifting a suspension,
- revocation of an exemption certificate, and
- grant of an exemption certificate with a condition or time limit.

These decisions do not include a direction of a review of a Safety Case.

9.2 The guidance in Booklet L30 indicates that all other means of resolving the matter should be fully explored with HSE, and that the duty holder can request a review of the decision by the Executive. This section describes the arrangements for carrying out such a review. It is written in terms of a decision not to accept a Safety Case, but it applies generally to all the decisions listed above. Where appropriate, it may also be a basis for an internal review of a decision to direct a review of a Safety Case.

Purpose of a review

9.3 A review is an internal HSE activity. The main purpose is to ensure that:

- the assessment was conducted fairly,
- the issues in contention were relevant,
- due account was taken of the facts and opinions presented, and
- OSD was entitled to reach the decision that it did.

It does not involve detailed peer review, nor an attempt to second-guess specialist opinion. The reviewer may have technical assistance and hear technical arguments; however, this is limited to understanding the issues involved, and to ensuring that OSD has taken full congnisance of the duty holder’s arguments and has reached a logical and consistent decision.

Summary of features

- It is a review by HSE’s Chief Executive, who can delegate all or part of the function to their deputy or to another senior manager. However, the conclusions letter to the duty holder is sent under the Chief Executive’s authority.
- The reviewer may ask a technical specialist [from outside OSD] to advise on interpretation of technical matters and, if necessary, someone from the Legal Advisor’s Office to advise on the law. A secretary may also be appointed.
- The reviewer considers written submissions from OSD, the duty holder and safety representatives. The reviewer may meet OSD and the duty holder, separately or together, to discuss their positions and see if there is any scope for common ground or for alternative solutions. Third parties are not involved unless the reviewer considers it beneficial.
- The review does not try to revisit complex technical issues. Rather, it focuses on whether the processes leading up to the decision were properly carried out, and OSD was entitled to take the view that it did. If procedures were materially misapplied, OSD will be directed to re-open the assessment.
- The Chief Executive gives a written judgement on the case, with the reasons for the views expressed. If finding in favour of the duty holder, the Chief Executive directs OSD to take appropriate action. The outcome is reported fully, so that all parties are aware of the scope and depth of the review.

Submission of an application for review

9.4 The duty holder applies in writing to the Chief Executive, within 3 weeks of receipt of the written decision or a subsequent meeting with the Head of OSD. The application includes:
- a summary of the reasons for seeking the review, and
- any supporting documentation submitted to OSD during the assessment
process. This can include information or opinion from third parties.


Conduct of the review

9.5 The review is carried out by the Chief Executive, who may delegate all or part of the review to a senior manager outside of OSD. The reviewer may ask other staff, such as technical specialists from outside OSD, or a member of the Legal Advisor’s Office, to assist.

9.6 The reviewer informs the relevant safety representatives of the duty holder’s reasons for seeking a review, and invites them to submit comments by a specified date. Any such comments are not attributed to individuals. If there is no resident workforce or no safety representatives [for example if the installation is stacked or operating abroad], the reviewer may make other arrangements to hear views from those whose health and safety may be affected by the matters under review.

9.7 OSD provides the reviewer with a summary of the assessment process, including;
- the points of contention,
- the work done to try to resolve them,
- OSD’s current position, and
- any proposals for resolution.

The duty holder provides a similar view on the points of contention, their current position and any proposals for resolution. New issues or arguments should not be raised.

9.8 If the duty holder has any concerns over the way OSD has followed its assessment procedures, the reviewer asks OSD to comment. If the concern is justified, the Chief Executive may ask OSD to re-open the assessment and deal with the concerns.

9.9 The reviewer considers the submission, and any from the employee representatives, and seeks any clarification required. The reviewer may meet OSD and the duty holder, separately or together, to see if there is any scope for common ground or for alternative solutions. Third parties may be involved if the reviewer considers it beneficial; however it is not the reviewers function to arbitrate between, or to second- guess, complex technical issues.

9.10 The reviewer considers in particular:
- if the decision was taken in accordance with OSD’s procedures and associated guidance,
- if the issues giving rise to the decision related to matters of significance within the scope of SCR, and were clearly described to the duty holder,
- if the responses from the duty holder were given due consideration,
- if there are any obvious flaws in OSD’s reasoning in making the decision,
and
- if there was any unfairness or bias in OSD’s assessment activity.

9.11 The Chief Executive gives a written view on the case, with reasons, to the parties
involved. Where appropriate, the Chief Executive may direct OSD to take particular action [accept the case, lift the suspension, etc]. Where practicable, the judgement is provided within 6 weeks of receipt of the review application

9.12 The review may find that the duty holder’s view has merit but there is no strong case for considering that OSD’s position is in error. It may then recommend further technical discussions take place, or simply indicate that there is insufficient reason to change the decision. This may be the case where there are strongly held opposing technical views.
Amendment

9.13 The Chief Executive may change any part of the procedure for a particular review. For any substantive change the Chief Executive will give the reasons for the change, and where appropriate will consult with the duty holder and OSD.
Charging

9.14 In the event of a review finding in favour of the duty holder, HSE will not normally charge for work related to the review.Project application and selection

3.1. Project ideas and partner search
INTERREG IVC provides the opportunity for institutions involved in regional policy to gain access to the experience of partners in other parts of Europe. Specific project ideas can be developed by regional and local authorities throughout Europe based on their specific responsibilities and interests. The search for partners should start at an early stage of the project’s preparation phase in order to properly involve the possible partners in the preparation of the proposal. Early contacts between the future partners also contribute to building trust and confidence within the partnership, which can facilitate the future management of the project. As far as partner search and the development of project ideas are concerned, the programme provides two main tools to future applicants.
First, a Project Idea and Partner Search Database is available on the programme’s website (www.interreg4c.eu). All those who would like to publish their project idea and market it to future potential partners are welcome to submit this idea through a standard form. Similarly, bodies looking for interesting project ideas can search this database using key words. It should be noted that the pro- gramme does not screen the ideas submitted in this database, nor guarantee their relevance to the programme.
Second, Partner Search Forums are regularly organised at programme level. At these forums, a certain number of facilities will be proposed to help participants to promote their project ideas or to find relevant partners according to the theme they are interested in. Details of these events are also published on the INTERREG IVC website.
The four Information Points based in Katowice, Lille, Rostock, and Valencia may also be able to facilitate partner search by identifying suitable partners in their area.

Member States are also strongly recommended to appoint National Contact Points for the INTERREG IVC programme. These contact points may provide additional assistance to project applicants. A current list of National Contact Points is available on the programme website (www.interreg4c.eu).

3.2. Preparing an application
As mentioned under section 3.1, the application should be developed in close cooperation with the future partners. The preparation of a good application can only be ensured after a careful study of the programme documents. In particular, the information provided in the programme manual is crucial for applicants. For instance, the description of the eligibility and quality criteria (see section 3.4) provides useful information on the programme requirements and on the way the applications are assessed.

Applications have to be completed in English as it is the working language of the programme. Applications submitted in another language will be considered ineligible.
The application form is an Excel document, which includes a number of automatic links and formula. These features ensure that error messages appear in the form if it is not properly filled in. This will significantly reduce the risk of submitting ineligible applications. This also means that the protection on the Excel document must not be removed. Detailed instructions on how to fill in the application form are also provided in the application form itself.
For further assistance on project development and application procedures, applicants should not hesitate to contact the Joint Technical Secretariat and the four Information Points by phone or e-mail. In addition, individual consultations or workshops for applicants will be regularly organised. All the relevant information for project development and applications including contact details for the JTS and for the Information Points is online on the programme’s website: www.interreg4c.eu

3.3. Submitting an application
Applications are submitted to the programme through calls for proposals, which are organised on a regular basis between 2007 and 2011. They can be submitted at any time between the launch date and the closing date of each call.
The application form has to be submitted electronically by e-mail, as well as in an unbound hard copy with the original wet ink signature (not faxed, scanned or otherwise duplicated). The paper version of the application form has to be identical to the electronic version and must include the co-financing statements from all partners including the Lead Partner. Applicants are advised not to send the electronic version before they are sure that there will be no further changes in the paper version.
The above-mentioned documents have to be sent to the Joint Technical Secretariat at the latest by the deadline set by the call for proposals. Applications or corrected documents sent after the deadline will not be accepted. This eligibility criterion will be checked through the date of the postal stamp on the envelope or through an equivalent proof of the date of sending to be provided with the sent documents.
Co-financing statements must be attached to the application for all partners including the Lead Partner. The original co-financing statements or copies must be sent together with the printed and signed application form by mail. The name of the partner mentioned in this statement has to be identical to the institution name mentioned in the application form, section 5. The amount of national co-financing provided must cover at least the amount indicated for the partner in section 5 of the application form. Lower amounts indicated would not ensure the required co-financing. They should, if available, be printed on headed letter paper of the institution. Finally, they must be dated, and signed by the relevant person within the institution and stamped, if available. Only the standard form included in the application pack can be used and the wording must not be amended. The template of the co-financing statement is available on the programme’s website.

3.4. Selection procedure
After submission, each application will be subject to a two-step selection procedure. At first, projects will be checked against the eligibility criteria in order to ensure that they fulfil the technical requirements of the programme. The eligibility assessment will be performed by the Joint Technical Secretariat. Only projects that satisfy the eligibility criteria will be subject to quality assessment. There is no possibility to submit corrected documents after the deadline for submission.
The quality assessment is based on a scoring system and results in a ranked list of all the applications submitted. It will be carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat with the assistance of external ex- perts.
Important: It should be noted that further or stricter criteria may be defined in the Terms of Reference of each call. In case of a contradiction between the information given in the Programme Manual and the Terms of Reference, the stricter criteria apply. The Terms of Reference are published on the programme website: www.interreg4c.eu.

3.4.1. Eligibility Criteria
The eligibility assessment is a ‘yes or no’ process. This means that the eligibility assessment does not allow any flexibility in the way the criteria are applied.
Each INTERREG IVC project has to answer ‘yes’ to the following eligibility criteria:

1. Has the application form been submitted in due time in original and electronic versions, both versions being identical? Is a proof of sending provided (postal stamp or equivalent)?
2. Is the application complete and include:
- the application form (original)?
- the co-financing statements for the Lead Partner and each partner (originals or copies)?
3. Is the application form dated and hand signed and fully and properly filled in according to the instructions (no error messages appear in the document)?
4. Are all co-financing statements signed and dated (if available they should also be stamped and printed on headed letter paper)? Is the name of the partner mentioned identical to the institution name mentioned in the application form? Does the sum stated in the statement at least cover the “national co-financing” amount (or the “total amount” in case of partners not applying for IN- TERREG IVC co-financing) indicated in the application form? Is the standard form included in the application pack used and, besides the fields to be filled, have no amendments been made to the text?
5. Is the project supported by partners from at least three countries, from which at least two partners are from EU Member States and are financed by the INTERREG IVC programme?
6. For mini-programmes, are a maximum of eight partners involved in the cooperation?

3.4.2. Quality Criteria
The quality assessment will only apply to projects that have fulfilled all eligibility criteria. It will be based on the following selection criteria:
- Content-related criteria
Criterion 1 - Relevance of the proposal
Criterion 2 - Coherence of the proposal and quality of approach Criterion 3 - Quality of results
- Implementation-related criteria Criterion 4 - Quality of management Criterion 5 - Quality of partnership Criterion 6 - Budget and finance
In order to decide on a score per criterion, the assessors use the ‘quality assessment guidelines’ which can be found in annex 4 of the present document. Applicants should have a careful look at these guidelines before preparing their application.

3.4.3. The Decision-Making Process
After completion of the first step of the assessment, the Committee will be informed about the ineligible applications. The Lead Applicants of these ineligible applications will receive a notification letter specifying the unfulfilled eligibility criteria.
The JTS may be assisted by external experts to carry out the quality assessment of eligible projects. This quality assessment is based on the following scoring system.

5 excellent 
4 good
3 adequate 
2 poor
1 very poor
0 knock-out criterion

A score will be attributed to each quality criterion (except in case of knock-out criterion). This will result in an average score per project. Based on this average score, the JTS will produce a ranking list of all the eligible projects per type of intervention. Projects with a sufficient average score will be re- commended for approval or recommended for approval under conditions. The remaining projects will not be recommended for approval.

Applications where a knock-out criterion is applied will not benefit from a full assessment. Only the reason(s) for knock-out will be developed and explained in the assessment results.
Final decisions on eligible projects will be made by the Monitoring Committee of the INTERREG IVC programme, based on the results of the quality assessment.
This decision will be notified to all Lead Applicants soon after the meeting of the Monitoring Commit- tee. All the Lead Applicants of the non-approved projects will receive a notification letter with a summary of the quality assessment results. They will therefore be informed about the reasons why their application failed. Similarly, all the Lead Partners of the approved projects will receive a letter from the Joint Technical Secretariat stating the decision of the Monitoring Committee as well as the total ERDF and possible Norwegian national funds approved. It is likely that the decision will include certain conditions deriving from the results of the quality assessment. A precise deadline for fulfilling these conditions will be set in the notification letter. Only after these conditions are fulfilled can the subsidy con- tract be concluded.
Enrollment Counts and Daily Attendance

(a) Procedures for conducting enrollment counts and daily attendance have been incorporated as follows:

1. All new students are required to register with their local school District prior to enrolling at the LEAP Academy. The Senior Administrator Enrollment Services directs new families to the proper District office and ensures that all required registration documentation is filed with the local District.

2. Daily student attendance is recorded in the school register during school hours on each day that the school is in session in accordance with N.J.A.C. 6:3-9. Students exceeding 10 days absent in a school year (excluding medical leaves) will be subject to grade retention. Four latenesses will count as an absence. Ongoing notification will be provided to families to ensure that attendance and late arrival issues are addressed immediately.

3. LEAP Academy will submit to the Commissioner of Education an enrollment report for the forthcoming year by June 1. Enrollment counts are to be conducted in October 15th and at end of the school year. The Senior Administrator Enrollment Services maintains all daily enrollment information and will prepare the enrollment counts in coordination with the School Business Administrator, building administrators and staff assigned to special services (Special Education and LEP). The enrollment data is submitted to the Commissioner of Education within three days of the enrollment count. LEAP Academy may not exceed its average daily enrollment as specified in the charter application.

4. All enrollment related functions are to be housed at the Office of Enrollment Services located in the upper school Main Office, including work area for Enrollment Specialist, DOENet Technical Manuals, enrollment documentation and copies of enrollment counts. The Senior Administrator Enrollment Services is to oversee the final preparation of enrollment counts, as well as report verifications and any additions or deletions. She communicates regularly with sending Districts to ascertain consistency and accuracy, as well as facilitate coordination. The School Business Administrator presents adjustments to the budget based in enrollment changes after the NJDOE has issued adjustment reports. The Board of Trustees will ratify budgetary adjustments at a regular meeting.

5. Passwords for entering into the electronic enrollment system are restricted to the Senior Administrator Enrollment Services, School Business Administrator and the Chief Learning Officer.

6. Monthly Enrollment updates are submitted to the Board of Trustees.
